# Channel should take in a generator G() (n,n), discriminator D() (n,n), codeword c (n,1), noise z (n,1), pcm H (m,n), 
    # such that:
      # c_hat, z_hat = D(G(c, z, H)), 
                                  # where z is optional or 0,
                                  # D can be trainable or have static weights,
                                  # and D recieves H from G.

# TRAIN
  # for {batch_ix, H, (m, c, z, r, c_llr, r_llr, magnitude, syndrome)} in enumerate(test_data):
      # z is either 0 or a structured noise process
      # z_G ~ G(c, z, H) such that,
      # z_out = z + z_G
      #
      # r = c + z_out
      # c_hat, z_hat = D(r, H) 
      # 
      # loss = loss_fn(c_hat, c)

# TEST
  # for {batch_ix, H, (m, c, z, r, c_llr, r_llr, magnitude, syndrome)} in enumerate(test_data):

      # for eb_no in Eb/Nos:
          # sigma calculated using eb_no
          # z ~ N(0, sigma) normally dist.
          # r = c + z

      # Eb = b/s bits per second transmitted through a channel 
      # No = Hz, Hz = k*T, for every T temperature units and k is Boltzmann's constant meaning more energy
